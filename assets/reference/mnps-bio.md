Data analyst at Metro Nashville Public Schools. 
My position is funded by a NIJ grant for the [Nashville Longitudinal Study of Youth Safety and Wellbeing (NLSYSW)](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2016/11/21/right-resources-at-the-right-time-goal-of-public-private-partnership-for-nashville-youths/). 
The study's purpose is to develop a comprehensive dataset that will empower empirical research on the relationships between student, school, and neighborhood risk and protective factors related to youth safety and wellbeing. 
My primary role is to advise the research team on relevant district data that should be used for the study, of which I clean and document. 
I also support the district's Student Support Services Department by working to decrease racial and ethnic disparities in office disciplinary referrals and use of exclusionary discipline throughout the district.
