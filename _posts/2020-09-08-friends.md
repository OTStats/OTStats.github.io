This week's Tidy Tuesday dataset presents the IMDb episode ratings for the hit sitcom, Friends. I decided to create a rank-lollipop chart to visualize how episode ratings compare within a given season. This was the first time I incorporated a custom font into ggplot, and I spent a decent chunk of time fine-tuning some aesthetics and annotations.

I'm overall very pleased with the outcome. You can reference my source code for this plot [here](bit.ly/2DWN1NJ) â€” I'm happy to answer any questions about my process or code. Thanks for reading!
