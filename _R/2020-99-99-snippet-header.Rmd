I first learned about [code snippets in RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets) from [Sean Lopp's talk about RStudio Tips and Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuSQgswZdr8) at the 2017 New York R Conference. Ever since seeing the video I utilized the built-in `if`, `fun`, and alike, but never got around to customizing my own.
