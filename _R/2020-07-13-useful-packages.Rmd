A few week's ago, [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/) featured Erin Grand's post: [Twitter's Favorite Lesser Known Packages](https://eringrand.github.io/fave_r_functions/). 
There was a plethora of responses where R-users packages/functions that they have found to be useful. I was inspired to and wanted to share a few of my favorites.

### `{beepr}`

One of my favorite R packages actually only has two functions. `beepr` is a package that plays notification sounds. I often add `beep()` to the end of long scripts and jobs running in the background. Instead of checking my RStudio session every so often I can simply wait for my computer to *ping*. 

Actually, on a few occasions I've used R as a timer:
```
library(beepr)

# Set a one minute timer
Sys.sleep(60); beep()
```

Of course, there are other packages with similar utility. [This StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3365657/is-there-a-way-to-make-r-beep-play-a-sound-at-the-end-of-a-script) includes various other packages, functions, and snippets that provide different notification methods.

### `{pacman}`

`pacman` is a package that I found courtesy of John Burn-Murdoch. 

### `{tictoc}`
