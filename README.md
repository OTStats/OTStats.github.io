# About

This houses code to support [my blog](https://otstats.github.io/). My blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and built on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. Originally, my blogposts were created solely using markdown. I was inspired by [David Robinson's blog](http://varianceexplained.org/), where he compiled his blog posts with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and R markdown using [this script](https://github.com/dgrtwo/dgrtwo.github.com/blob/master/_scripts/knitpages.R). I [modified his script](https://github.com/otstats/otstats.github.io/blob/master/_scripts/knitpages.R) and now compile all of my posts in R markdown.

The purpose of my blog is to share analyses that I have conducted in my free time, document my learning as a R programmer, and improve my written communication. Feel free to contact me if you have questions about the blog or a post.

## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:
