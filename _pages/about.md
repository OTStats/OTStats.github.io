## Background
I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics and statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where I also competed on the men's soccer team. 
After a brief stint working on a data quality/collection team in the sports industry, I transitioned into a data analytics/reporting position in E-commerce at Kohl's supporting the digital vendor marketing team. 
In August 2019, my fiance and I moved from Milwaukee to Nashville to flee the Wisconsin winters and experience something new. 
I'm currently a data analyst at Proc9.

My professional interests include statistics, data analysis, and R-programming. 
Out of the office, I enjoy following Spanish soccer and being active. 
Two weeks into my coronavirus quarantine my neighbor convinced me to buy a pair of rollerblades, and I've been skating obsessively since. 
When I'm not outside or traveling, you can find me reading, exploring new music, or researching random topics.
